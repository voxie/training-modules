# Module 3: Docker Compose

## Introduction
In the previous Docker module, we saw an example of a container running both php-fpm and nginx. Docker Compose allows us to easily run multiple containers alongside each other, and well mirror our production environments. It aims to simplify this process by using a `docker-compose.yaml` file to define the services, networks, and volues. After this module, you should be comfortable with basic tasks required to interact and manage a local container environment.

For this module, *create a new Git repo* for your Docker Compose work in Module 3.

If you haven't already, it is recommended that you read through each of the official documentation resources listed below and follow some of the links within each resource to help clarify specific tools and their purposes.

Resources and articles:

## Completing the Module

1. Create a file called _docker-compose.yaml_
2. In your _docker-compose.yaml_ file, add a new service called `hello-container` with the image `hello-world`
3. Create a new file called _docker-compose-module.txt_, and paste the output of `docker-compose up`.

    > If you look from the top of the output, you should be able to see the
    process that docker-compose goes through to start the `hello-container` service.
    A new image is pulled, started, and exits, just like you would do by hand
    to start and stop a container.

4. Commit your changes and push up.
5. Create a new directory called _scripts_.
6. In that new directory, create a new executable file called _welcome-compose.sh_ containing the following:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, Docker Compose!'
```
7. Update the `hello-world` service in your _docker-compose.yaml_ file to use your `gentux/alpine-bash` image from module 2.
8. In the _docker-compose.yaml_ file, mount the new `./scripts` directory as the `/home/scripts` directory within the `hello-container` service.
9. Update the `hello-container` service to run the _welcome-docker.sh_ file and paste the output of `docker-compose up`.
10. Commit your changes and push up.
11. Create a new service called `data-container` that uses the `alpine:latest` image and mounts the same volumes as the `hello-container` service.
12. Update the `hello-container` service to mount the volumes from the `data-container` service and paste the output of `docker-compose up`.
13. Commit your changes and push up.

### Final

Update the _docker-compose.yaml_ file to fulfill the following requirements:
1. A network defined as _modules_.
1. An app service using the `gentux/php:lumen-5.6-ci` image, mounting the current directory to `/var/www`, and attached to the _modules_ network.
2. A web service using the `gentux/nginx:fpm` image, exposing port 80 on port 80 locally, a [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#links) to the app service with an alias of _fpm.local_, and attached to the _modules_ network.
3. A mysql service using `mysql:5.6`, exposing port 3306 on port 3306 locally, attached to the _modules_ network, and using envinroment variables to set a root password of `secret`, a database name of `modules`, a user name of `modules`, and a user password of `secret`.

## Wrapping Up

When you are done, verify you have pushed your changes to GitHub. Please create a tag called v1.0 with a message of "ready for review" in your docker compose repo. Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitHub.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 3 - Docker Compose** and assign it to [**@generationtux-helmsmen**](https://github.com/generationtux-helmsmen).
