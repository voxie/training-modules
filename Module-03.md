# Module 3: PHP Coding Standards

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material.  

* [PHP PSR-2 Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)


## The Test

Create a new branch in your `php-final` git repo called `psr-2` and refactor your PHP code to conform to the PSR-2 standard.  Be sure to write all your future PHP code to conform to PSR-2.

----------

When you are done, push your code to Bitbucket.  Please create a tag called `v1.3` with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in Bitbucket.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 3 - Coding Standards** and @mention all team leaders and department head.
